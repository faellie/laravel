This project is done following https://www.techiediaries.com/php-laravel-crud-mysql-tutorial/
First create the project with composer:

composer create-project  --prefer-dist  laravel/laravel laravel-first-crud-app
update .env with  local db information
[zihuangw@localhost laravel-first-crud-app]$ php artisan migrate ==> this seems is not needed at all
(probably a mistake in the tutorial, it make sense, since we did notthing after create the project)

Create the data model:
[zihuangw@localhost laravel-first-crud-app]$ php artisan make:model Contact --migration
update the newly created file ./laravel-first-crud-app/database/migrations/2020_02_16_165746_create_contacts_table.php
[zihuangw@localhost laravel-first-crud-app]$ php artisan migrate:refresh

Note: make sure you did not have a database called db already, if so, you can always delete the database : mysql> drop database dbname
Or use a different database (.env)

Update Contact.php
Create Controller
[zihuangw@localhost laravel-first-crud-app]$ php artisan make:controller ContactController --resource

Update web.php for the routes
Update ContactController for method create() and store() (Remember to include use App\Contact;)

Create ./laravel/laravel-first-crud-app/resources/views/base.blade.php and update

Creeate (include fir) /opt/LI/laravel/laravel-first-crud-app/resources/views/contacts/create.blade.php and update

Run php artisan serve from the project dir and you shall have something at
http://127.0.0.1:8000/contacts/create
Note: To now the gui form is not styled.

create and update /opt/LI/laravel/laravel-first-crud-app/resources/views/contacts/index.blade.php

Create and update /opt/LI/laravel/laravel-first-crud-app/resources/views/contacts/edit.blade.php

Note we also need to update the functions (e.g. edit/update) in ContactController

We need to add blocks for navigation and etc in index.blade.php
    <div class="col-sm-12">

      @if(session()->get('success'))
        <div class="alert alert-success">
          {{ session()->get('success') }}
        </div>
      @endif
    </div>

    <div>
        <a style="margin: 19px;" href="{{ route('contacts.create')}}" class="btn btn-primary">New contact</a>
        </div>
Note: To now the gui form is not styled.  Lets try to make it happen next. But I will checkin the code for now. As I think the code generated next should not be in the repo.
